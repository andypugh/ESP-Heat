ESP32 Heating Controller
==============

A multi-zone central heating controller based on the ESP32.

It can be configured for an almost unlimited number of zones, pumps and separate boilers.
Boiler run-on is supported, and configurable. 
Temperature sensing assumes DS18B20 sensors. 
One zone per valve, and it is assumed that zone valves trip microswitches when open. 
 
Branches: 
no_master: Uses GPIO to read from the DS18B20 sensors

master: using a DS2482 1-wire master adaptor for longer cable runs. Using WebServer
to handle http requests. 

WiFiServer: Initial version using wiFi server and parsing incoming URLs byte-by-byte
 
The DS2482-100 is a I2C->1-Wire bridge (http://www.maximintegrated.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/4382),
contains functionality that means it is better at driving long and complex networks. 

I used a DS2482-800 which additionally expands the bus to 8 separate channels, which allows
for longer single-ended networks.
For simplicity, using this break-out board.

Here is the main screen, showing a diagram of the house, with the temperature of each zone. 
The shape and position of each room is defined by an SVG path, for example:
"M250 350 v190 h140 v-190 z"
So that almost any house layout (or limited graphical elements for tanks etc) can be defined.

Here is one of the programming screens

And the setup screen where the pins for each valve and pump etc can be defined, as well
as the house layout and the temperature sensor allocation.

And here is one iteration of the hardware installed in a consumer unit case with
Neutrik connectors for the pumps and valves and CB connectors for the temperature sensors:
